# Project Name: AI-DOT-GOAL

## One-Sentence Summary

AI-DOT-GOAL (AI Goal Planner): An AI-powered Goal Management & Habit Formation Platform that integrates **AI Planning**, **Staking Mechanism**, and **Social Witnessing** into one. From **Key Points (`DOT`)** to **Big `GOAL`**, helping everyone achieve their goals more scientifically and efficiently.

## Features

- Users can set their goals, stake PAS tokens, and invite multiple friends as witnesses. If the user completes their goal before the deadline and gets confirmation from the witnessing friends, they can redeem their staked tokens. If the goal is not completed, the witnessing friends can share the staked tokens.
- Users can update their progress with text and images at any time under their goals.
- The platform will create an **AI Goal Planner** AI Agent (based on **Eliza + LLM**) for each goal. It can provide suggestions and feasible plans for how users can achieve their goals, and users can interact with the AI Goal Planner through conversation to better accomplish their goals.
- The platform issues its own token: `AIG`, providing incentives based on user and witness participation (comments, tips, suggestions, etc.).
